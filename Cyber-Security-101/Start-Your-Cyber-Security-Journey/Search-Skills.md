## 📂 Room Walkthrough

### 🔹 Task 1 – Introduction
- Quick overview of what the room is about and what learners will achieve.

---

### 🔹 Task 2 – Evaluation of Search Results
- The internet is full of unverified opinions, so it's important to evaluate what you read.

#### How to evaluate:
- **Source**: Is it published by a trusted person or organization?
- **Evidence**: Are there facts and logical arguments supporting the claims?
- **Bias**: Is it presented objectively and fairly?
- **Corroboration**: Can other trusted sources confirm this information?

---

### 🔹 Task 3 – Search Engines
- Search engines offer tools to narrow down and improve results.

#### Useful Google search operators:
- `"exact phrase"` → Finds exact matches in quotes.
- `site:` → Search within a specific site.  
  Example: `site:tryhackme.com success stories`
- `-` → Excludes words.  
  Example: `pyramids -tourism`
- `filetype:` → Search for specific file types (e.g. PDFs, PPTs).  
  Example: `filetype:ppt cyber security`

### 🔹 Task 4 – Specialized Search Engines

#### 🔎 Shodan
- Finds internet-connected devices like webcams, routers, or servers.

#### 🔎 Censys
- Focuses on internet hosts and services, such as websites, domains, and certificates.

#### 🔎 VirusTotal
- Upload files or URLs and scan them using many antivirus engines.  
- Can also search by file hashes.  
- Community comments often help explain why something was flagged.

#### 🔎 Have I Been Pwned
- Checks if an email address has been exposed in a data breach.

---

### 🔹 Task 5 – Vulnerabilities and Exploits

#### 🛠️ CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- Each known vulnerability has a unique ID like `CVE-2025-23294`.
- Managed by MITRE and used by security professionals for consistency.

#### 🛠️ Exploit Database
- A collection of public exploit code.  
- Useful for red teams (with permission).  
- Exploits may be marked as verified.

- **Tip**: GitHub also hosts tools and exploits related to CVEs.

---

### 🔹 Task 6 – Technical Documentation

#### 📚 Linux Manual Pages
- Use `man` command to access help on Linux commands.  
  Example: `man ip`

#### 📚 Microsoft Docs
- Microsoft provides full documentation for its tools and systems.

#### 📚 Product Docs
- Most major software products (e.g., Apache, PHP, Node.js) have official documentation.  
- Always check docs before relying on third-party guides.

---

### 🔹 Task 7 – Social Media
- Social media is a powerful way to follow cyber security trends and connect with professionals.

#### Notes:
- Use a temp email if needed to explore anonymously.
- Be cautious about oversharing — personal details can be used in social engineering.
- Stay up to date on threats, tools, and best practices.

---

### 🔹 Task 8 – Conclusion
- This room showed how to search smarter, validate sources, use tools like Shodan or VirusTotal, and learn from social media and documentation.

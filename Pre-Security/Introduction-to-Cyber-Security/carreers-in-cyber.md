## 🔍 Room Walkthrough
It basically just gives information on the different careers.

** Security Analyst**
> Responsible for maintaining the security of an organisation's data
> construct security measures across organisatinos to protect the company from attacks
> explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures
> requires working with various stakeholders

> ** Responsibilities **
> Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
> Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures
> Develop security plans -> research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed to maintain data security

** Security Engineer **
> Design, monitor and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks
> develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data
> work across a breadth of attacks (web application attacks, network threats, evolving trends and tactics)
> ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss

> **Responsibilities **
> Testing and screening security measures across software
> Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilites
> Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

** Incident Responder **
> Identifies and mitigates attacks whilst an attacker operations are still unfolding
> respond to security breaches
> create plans, policies and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents.
> highly pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time
> response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover from attacks.
> aim mis to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications
> protect company's data, reputation, and financial standing from a cyber attack

> ** Responsibilities **
> Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
> Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
> Post-incident reporting and preperation of future attacks -> learnings and adaptations

** Digital Forensics Examiner **
> Responsible for using digital forensics to investigate incidents and crimes
> kind of a detective
> collect and analyse evidence to help solve crimes

> ** Responsibilities **
> Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
> Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
> Document you findings and report

** Malware Analyst **
> Analyses all types of malware to learn more about how they work and what they do
> write reports about the findings
> core task = converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code
> need strong programming background (assembly and C)

>  ** Responsibilities **
> Carry out static analysis of malicious programs
> Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activites in a controlled environment
> Document and report all the findings

** Penetration Tester **
> Responsible for testing technology products for security loopholes
> test security of the systems and software within a company -> through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through hacking
> exploit these vulnerabilites to evaluate risk in each instance

> ** Responsibilities **
> Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
> Perform security assesments, audits, and analyse policies
> Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

** Red Teamer **
> Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organisation and providing feedback from an enemies perspective
> share similarities to penetration testers
> Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems vs. red teamers test company's detection and response capabilities
> requires imitating cyber criminals' actions
>
> ** Responsibilities **
> Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
> Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
> Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
